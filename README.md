Using Scrapy, I captured concert data from the website of Bowery Presents, a concert promotion and venue management organization, for use as primary market data (240 observations over 6-7 months). I then scraped SeatGeek, an event ticket marketplace and aggregator, to capture resale prices for these shows (17 venues across 11 cities). Captured data included artist and opener names, city, venue, date, ticket price, and whether or not a show was sold out. I then took each of these artists and used Spotify API to get metrics on popularity, followers and genre.

The purpose of this project was to analyze primary and secondary market concert ticket data in order to better equip artists to make decisions on ticket pricing, concert promotion, venue selection and the number of shows to play in a city.
